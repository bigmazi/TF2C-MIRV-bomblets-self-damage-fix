# TF2C-MIRV-bomblets-self-damage-fix
Fixes MIRV bomblets doing 2 times more self-damage than intended

MIRV bomblets deal 90 damage vs anything except vs their owner: in this case they deal 180 damage.
I haven't managed to find a good reason for it to exist hence I consider it to be a bug.

The plugin makes bomblets deal half the current damage vs their owner.
